      <h1>Hello World! </h1>
        <br>My name is Annelise! I am a senior at Davidson, and I am majoring in Arab Studies and Digital & Screen Media Studies.
        <br>I am taking this course because I designed many websites in WordPress but want to learn more about web development. Also, I'm designing a website for my capstone project, so this class will be very relevant!
        I have designed several sites using WordPress & have some Squarespace experience. I do not have any coding experience but am excited to learn!
      <div>
        <p>Goals:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Learn the various coding languages enough to use them for my own projects going forward</li>
              <li>Learn to design a site from scratch (for my capstone/future web design gigs)</li>
              <li>I hope to have fun! It's easy to get distracted from the fun of learning by a busy schedule or heavy workload, but I hope to enjoy myself in this learning process.</li>
            </ul>
      <div>
        <p>Learn-computing activity:
          <br>I did the "Users, permissions, the filesystem" activity. I learned about what users can do (read, write, execute files) and how to find the information about those permissions in the terminal.
          I learned how to look for file extensions and what apps they open.
          I also learned that hidden files exist, and they can be found through the terminal, although I'm still not sure why there are hidden files.
          Does "hidden" just mean that they don't show up on the desktop or in the download folder?
          <br>I was not able to view the contents of my trash when I typed "ls -la .Trash" -- I received the message "ls: .Trash: Operation not permitted." Is that a setting I have to change on my computer?

        <p>Websites:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <a href="https://asylumworks.org/" target="_blank">
              Asylum Works</a>
                <br>This is the website of a refugee assistance organization in DC that I nearly interned with a few years ago.
              I learned about their organization through their website. I like it because it has a consistent color scheme,
              many high-quality images, some animation, and is clean, clearly organized, and easy to navigate.
              <li>
                <a href="http://radio.garden/visit/davidson-nc/bNkBxCcs" target="_blank">
              Radio Garden</a>
                <br>I was introduced to this site in DIG210, and I have already used it to find WNCW,
              my family's favorite radio station from Spindale, NC, and a station in Iran where I can practice listening to Farsi.
              This radio-finder website site is fascinating because it is interactive, highly visual, and it enables me
              to tune into radio stations anywhere in the world, regardless of my location.</br>

            The Ultimate Collection of Google Font Pairings (Displayed Beautifully with Classic Art)</a>
                <br>This site combines different google fonts with classic art. I like this site for aesthetic reasons (it's pretty!)
              because it is useful. I use it when looking for font combinations when working on design projects.
              I can either copy the code or download the font pair when I find a font that I like. Here is an example of the fonts + art:</br>

<!-- Comment: the most difficult part was figuring out which commands to use where.
I wasn't sure if I should use <p> or <br>, for example, and it took me a few iterations to figure out which format looked best.
I also had to make sure that I closed each command with the backslash. My whole text was in h1 for a while because I forgot to add "/" to the closing command! -->
